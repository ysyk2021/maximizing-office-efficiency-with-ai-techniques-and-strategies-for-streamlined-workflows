Predictive analytics is a technique that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and generate predictions about future outcomes. By analyzing large amounts of data, predictive analytics can help businesses forecast trends, anticipate demand, and identify opportunities for growth.

One example of predictive analytics in action is its use in forecasting sales. With historical data on sales trends and customer behavior, machine learning algorithms can generate accurate predictions of future sales numbers, allowing businesses to plan accordingly.

Utilizing Machine Learning-Powered Recommendation Engines for Personalized Marketing and Product Offerings
